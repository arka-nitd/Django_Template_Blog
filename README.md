# Django_Template_Blog

Recently updated to work with Django Version 1.11.

This is a template Django blog with template functions. 
Some of them are there to provide functionality with openLdap (e.g. add a new user).

All passwords are "default" so change them if you ever try to use this in production.

I reccomend you to "pull request" more functionality, or frontend beauty as it has none, and then use it for your own Django tutorial.

## How to use

Let's start with a virtualenv installation.

``` sudo apt install python-pip
pip install virtualenv
mkdir ~/.virtualenv
sudo(?) easy_install virtualenv
virtualenv .virtualenv
source .virtualenv/bin/activate
```
