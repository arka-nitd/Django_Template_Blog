=== Contributing to this project ===

Well, this project is not much, just a tutorial for Django + OpenLdap, that has yet to be shaped like and actual tutorial.
So I need your helo with that :) 

I have openden some issues, and to start contributing just dive in or ask me how to in the comments section.
I have no real guidelines, so we can make them together along the way :)

Can't wait for your pull requests.

Let's learn about git, Django, Openldap and FOSS, together.
